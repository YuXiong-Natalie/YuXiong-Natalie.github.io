												<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>As a cultural researcher, I spend a significant amount of time understanding
											the values and norms of distinct cultural groups.This means taking others’ perspectives
											and not making assumptions from my personal background. 
											This experience also helped me with developing effective teaching strategies. 
											As Psychology naturally appeals to most students, I taught students from a wide range of majors. 
											Talking to them requires me to adapt technical details to their background and help them establish the relevance 
											of psychological questions to their majors. Seeing my studentslearning the concepts, 
											internalizing critical thinking, evaluating arguments, 
											and applying learned methodologies and skills in their own work and research 
											has been extremely rewarding.</p>
											
											<p> In the psychology courses I have taught, students often came from different disciplines and had different learning goals: 
												Some students might be pursuing further studies in psychology and were thus particularly interested in evaluating the validity of evidence and research methods. 
												For other students, psychology might not be their primary specialization but would be a useful tool in their own research, work, and daily life. 
												I want to create a classroom that can benefit both types of audiences. When students leave my classroom, I hope that they have 
												(1) received accurate information about psychology theories and research methodologies, 
												(2) become comfortable with reviewing literature and learning research methods for their own research or work, and 
												(3) developed a taste of what is psychological thinking and how does it contribute to 3 human knowledge along with other disciplines. 
												To achieve these objectives, I plan to take the following approaches:.</p>

											<h3>Culturally Sensitive</h3>
											<p>One major concern when we talk about psychological findings is that most evidence is based on ‘WEIRD’ samples, that is White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. 99% of all published studies rely on participants recruited from populations that fit those criteria. Thus, I always kept in mind that what I talked about can be limited by the sample, either by a within-country difference, such as high socioeconomic status versus low socioeconomic status, or by a between-country difference, such as the collectivist cultural heritage in East Asia versus the individualistic culture in the West. One major goal of my teaching is to cultivate this cultural sensitivity in my students so that they can understand differences rather than ignoring or judging them. 
											To do this, I will make sure to cover evidence from underrepresented samples and elicit discussions on potential differences across groups.</p>
											<h3>Interdisciplinary Perspectives</h3>
											<p> My unique academic background in Economics and Psychology has instilled in me an interdisciplinary perspective. Researchers from both disciplines are curious about human behavior but choose to focus on different aspects of it and delve into different mechanisms. However, the difference should not be a gap preventing communications but should be bonded by the common goal of understanding human nature as well as accumulating evidence for arguments. Thus, in my teaching, I encourage students to think across borders and develop a broader perspective on social science. To do this, I will integrate knowledge from other disciplines to explain human behavior. 
											I will draw evidence not only from developmental psychology but also from cognitive, clinical, even sociology, and economics.</p>
											<h3>Concept Understanding and Critical Thinking.</h3>
											<p> A common difficulty in learning Psychology is developing conceptual thinking. Concepts to psychologists are like equations to mathematics, logic to philosophers, and data to data scientists. Developing the ability to clarify a concept, operate a concept, and develop arguments around concepts is essential for psychological thinking. For this goal, I plan to highlight the importance of reading, discussion, and writing in my class. The best way to train conceptual thinking is to first read others’ conceptual work, understand it, and evaluate it. To do so, I will focus on classical theories and concurrent evidence. 
											I will also encourage questions and discussions to cultivate conceptual thinking in my class.</p>
											<h3>Technology Exposure and Problem-Solving</h3>
											<p>A key change for social science compared to decades ago is that we rely more on data and sophisticated statistical tools. Learning to use tools and be comfortable solving new technical problems is essential for one to advance understanding. Even in developmental psychology, as researchers, we must constantly learn new techniques for research. Thus, a key goal of my course design is to keep updated with technology and facilitate students’ exposure to tools so that they develop the habit of using up-to-date tools to solve problems. To do this, I will integrate commonly used coordination tools, literature management tools, as well as statistical tools in my class.
											I will emphasize project work so that students can get exposed to using technology to solve concrete examples. </p>
